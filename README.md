## Project Objectives
The main goal is to create a program that represents a user's bank account and allows basic banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

---

## Create a program that meets the following:

1. When a bank account is created, the initial balance should be set to **zero**.
2. The user should be able to **deposit** money, which increases the account balance.
3. The user should be able to **withdraw** money, which decreases the account balance.
4. The user should be able to **check the current balance**.
5. A message should be printed whenever a **deposit or withdrawal** occurs, including the **date and time** of the transaction.
